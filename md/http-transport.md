# HTTP / WebSocket Transport

`agent-client-protocol-http` exposes ACP agents over one `/acp` endpoint.

- `POST /acp` with `initialize` creates a connection and returns `Acp-Connection-Id`.
- Later `POST /acp` requests include `Acp-Connection-Id`; session-scoped requests also include `Acp-Session-Id` or `params.sessionId`.
- `GET /acp` with `Accept: text/event-stream` streams agent messages over SSE. Use a connection-level stream for connection-scoped messages and per-session streams for session-scoped messages.
- `GET /acp` with a WebSocket upgrade uses text frames for JSON-RPC messages.
- `DELETE /acp` tears down the connection.

`POST /acp` request bodies are limited to 16 MiB.

## Diagnostic Privacy

Ordinary transport diagnostics use byte lengths, fixed message kinds, stream
scope, and fixed failure labels rather than message bodies. They do not format
raw methods, request/session IDs, WebSocket close reasons, or transport error
text, which can contain prompts, file/image content, or credential-bearing URLs.
This does not change messages or errors delivered through the protocol.

Opt-in [conductor recordings](./trace-viewer.md#recording-privacy) are different:
they intentionally retain protocol payloads and must be treated as sensitive.
This policy covers diagnostics emitted by the HTTP transport crate, not logs
from applications or underlying libraries.

## JSON-RPC Batches

`HttpClient` starts every connection with an individual `initialize` and
requires an individual initialize response. For compatibility with other
clients, the server also accepts an initial batch when its first call-shaped
entry is an `initialize` request. Valid and malformed response-only entries may
precede it and are ignored; an invalid or call-shaped predecessor rejects the
batch as an initial frame. The server forwards the complete frame and returns
the complete grouped response in the POST response body; a successful
initialize also adds `Acp-Connection-Id`. Lifecycle-sensitive calls should
normally remain individual. If the agent emits a notification or callback
before the initialize response is ready, including from a batched sibling, the
server buffers that frame for the connection's SSE stream until initialization
completes.

After initialization, both transport shapes preserve batches:

- On an established HTTP connection, one complete batch occupies one POST
  body. The server returns `202 Accepted`; any grouped JSON-RPC reply is
  delivered through SSE as one array.
- WebSocket sends one complete batch in one text frame and writes its grouped
  reply in one text frame.
- A grouped HTTP reply is sent to a session stream only when all correlated
  entries have the same session route. If routes differ, it is sent on the
  connection-level stream so the array remains intact.

Entry validation, notification-only behavior, empty arrays, and malformed
response filtering follow the shared [transport batch
contract](./transport-architecture.md#json-rpc-batch-behavior).

## HTTP + SSE Streams

After `initialize`, clients should open a connection-level SSE stream:

- `GET /acp`
- `Accept: text/event-stream`
- `Acp-Connection-Id: <connection id>`
- no `Acp-Session-Id`

This stream carries connection-scoped messages.

Session-scoped messages are routed to session-specific SSE streams. For each
active session, clients should also open:

- `GET /acp`
- `Accept: text/event-stream`
- `Acp-Connection-Id: <connection id>`
- `Acp-Session-Id: <session id>`

Open a session stream before sending methods such as `session/prompt`,
`session/load`, `session/resume`, or other session-scoped requests. When a
`session/new` or `session/fork` response returns a new `sessionId`, open an SSE
stream for that returned session before expecting updates or responses for it.

## Features

The crate does not enable either transport side by default. Opt into only the side(s) you need.

```toml
agent-client-protocol-http = { version = "...", features = ["client"] }
agent-client-protocol-http = { version = "...", features = ["server"] }
agent-client-protocol-http = { version = "...", features = ["client", "server"] }
```

The `client` feature exposes `HttpClient`. The `server` feature exposes
`AcpHttpServer`, `ServerOptions`, and `CorsOptions`.

## Request Cancellation

Request cancellation is available through the core SDK:

```toml
agent-client-protocol-http = { version = "...", features = ["client", "server"] }
```

`$/cancel_request` is connection-scoped. The HTTP transport does not apply
`Acp-Session-Id` to cancellation notifications, and routes outgoing
cancellation notifications over the connection stream rather than a session
stream.

WebSocket connections can carry cancellation at any point after the socket is
open. With HTTP + SSE, cancellation can be sent after `initialize` completes and
the client has received `Acp-Connection-Id`; an in-flight `initialize` request
cannot be cancelled with a hop-local `$/cancel_request` on this transport shape.

## Server

```rust
use agent_client_protocol_http::AcpHttpServer;

let app = AcpHttpServer::new(|| my_agent()).into_router();
let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;
axum::serve(listener, app).await?;
```

Cross-origin browser access is disabled by default. Enable it by allowlisting
the browser origins that should be able to access the ACP endpoint:

```rust
use agent_client_protocol_http::{AcpHttpServer, CorsOptions, ServerOptions};

let app = AcpHttpServer::new(|| my_agent())
    .with_options(
        ServerOptions::default()
            .with_cors(CorsOptions::allow_origins(["http://localhost:5173"])?),
    )
    .into_router();
```

`ServerOptions` is non-exhaustive. Start from `ServerOptions::default()` and use
`with_path(...)`, `with_cors(...)`, and `with_health_endpoint(...)`; its fields
remain public for reading and mutation. Defaults remain `/acp`, disabled CORS,
and an enabled `/health` endpoint. See the [config API migration](./migration-config-api.md)
for replacing struct literals and update syntax.

### Browser authentication and credential policy

CORS controls browser cross-origin access; it does **not** authenticate clients.
The WebSocket origin check accepts requests without an `Origin` header, so an
origin allowlist is not a substitute for authentication.

The built-in CORS policy allows ACP transport headers, but not `Authorization`,
and does not enable credentialed CORS (`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`).
`CorsOptions::allow_any_origin()` is a wildcard origin policy, not an
authentication or credential policy.

Hosts that need bearer headers, cookies, or another credential policy should
enforce authentication on the router returned by `into_router()` and supply
their own CORS layer. Leave `ServerOptions::cors` disabled when providing that
HTTP CORS layer to avoid stacking conflicting policies. The separate WebSocket
origin check still uses `CorsOptions`; with the built-in policy disabled it
rejects upgrades carrying an `Origin` header. Browser WebSocket hosts can use
an explicit `CorsOptions::allow_origins(...)` allowlist, but a host needing a
different credentialed HTTP CORS policy and browser WebSocket origins on the
same endpoint needs additional host routing/policy integration beyond these
options. This SDK does not provide a general authentication configuration.

## Client

```rust
use agent_client_protocol_http::HttpClient;

let transport = HttpClient::new("http://127.0.0.1:8080")?;
my_client().connect_to(transport).await?;
```

The same `HttpClient` also speaks WebSocket — pass a `ws://` or `wss://` URL
and it will open a single bidirectional connection instead of using POST + SSE:

```rust
let transport = HttpClient::new("ws://127.0.0.1:8080")?;
my_client().connect_to(transport).await?;
```
